## Abstract

Information-Centric Networking is still an incomplete paradigm which introduces alarge variety of new topics and approaches over the traditional networking. Sinceit is a relatively new concept which promises for easier and faster data access manyaspects of it have been studied intensely in recent years. Nonetheless, load balancingis one of the least focused but high potency, open-ended areas. The aim of thisproject is to present an alternative technique to load balancing in the domain ofpre-suggested routing method LSCR (Link State Content Routing). We suggestedmulti-path interest and multi-source data packet routing on the bases of Forwardingand Routing Tables of LSCR and packet routing protocol of Source Routing. Wehave developed a simulator software to implement and test the multi-path routingalgorithm. Multi-path routing and LSCR are compared with regard to the load ofthe links, package loss, package delay and overall network performance
